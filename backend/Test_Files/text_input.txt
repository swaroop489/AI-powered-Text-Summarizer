Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans. These intelligent machines are capable of learning from experience, adapting to new inputs, and performing human-like tasks. The history of AI dates back to the mid-20th century, when pioneers such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy laid the foundations of this field. Turing proposed the famous Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence, while McCarthy coined the term “Artificial Intelligence” and organized the first AI conference in 1956.  Over the decades, AI has evolved tremendously, from rule-based expert systems in the 1970s and 1980s to modern machine learning and deep learning techniques. The introduction of neural networks, inspired by the human brain, enabled machines to recognize patterns and solve complex problems. With the growth of computational power and the availability of massive datasets, AI has achieved remarkable success in various domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and autonomous systems.  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. NLP enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a meaningful way. Some common NLP applications include sentiment analysis, language translation, text summarization, and chatbots. For instance, transformer-based models like BERT, GPT, and BART have revolutionized NLP by providing state-of-the-art performance on numerous language tasks. Text summarization, in particular, allows AI systems to condense long documents into concise summaries while retaining the essential meaning.
