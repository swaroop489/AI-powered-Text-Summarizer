Abstractive Summary:
- Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and act like humans.
- These intelligent machines are capable of learning from experience, adapting to new inputs, and performing human-like tasks.
- The history of AI dates back to the mid-20th century, when pioneers such as Alan Turing and John McCarthy laid the foundations of this field.

Extractive Summary:
- These intelligent machines are capable of learning from experience, adapting to new inputs, and performing human-like tasks.
- Turing proposed the famous Turing Test as a criterion for machine intelligence, while McCarthy coined the term “Artificial Intelligence” and organized the first AI conference in 1956.
- Over the decades, AI has evolved tremendously, from rule-based expert systems in the 1970s and 1980s to modern machine learning and deep learning techniques.
- The introduction of neural networks, inspired by the human brain, enabled machines to recognize patterns and solve complex problems.
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subfield of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.
