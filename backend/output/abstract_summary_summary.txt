Abstractive Summary:
- The size and shape of the public domain shifts depending on the territory of the creator as well as the territory in which one seeks to exploit a derivative work.
- UK copyright in previously unpub-lished work does not presently expire until 1 January 2039.
- Once the term has passed, works become freely available for use.
- Public domain availability makes a significant difference to inclusion of images on Wikipedia.
- Pages with public domain images attracted between 17 and 19 per cent more visitors than pages where no image was available.

Extractive Summary:
- What policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain mate-rials, and what are the likely impacts?
- The perceived risk of a legal challenge may dissuade creators from making use of ideas and works in the public domain.
- Byblos’argument that Rowling has used elements from the public domain does not in principle affect the possibility that Rowling’s book (in which the storyline is developed) is a work for the purposes of the Copyright Act.
- 12 per cent of the images con-tained in our sample of biographical pages of authors, lyricists and composers were used under unrestrictive open licences such as Creative Commons.
- The actual rate of use of Creative Commons licensed images on Wikipedia is likely higher, since our sample comprised a large number of subjects whose deathoccurred more than 70 years ago.
