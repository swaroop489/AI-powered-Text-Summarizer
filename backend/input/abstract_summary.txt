Kris Erickson, Martin Kretschmer and Dinusha Mendis. ‘An empirical approach to the public domain’ ‘Creative practices in the digital era and access to the reservoir of works and ideas that we call ‘the public Domain’ are intertwined in complex ways. This chapter outlines and explains the methodological approach adopted in defining the ‘public domain’ The size and shape of the public domain shifts depending on the territory of the creator as well as the territory in which one seeks to exploit a derivative work. This chapter, based on a larger project exploring copyright and the valueof the public Domain, seeks to address the call by Dobusch to empirically address the value of thepublic domain in relation to actual use. The nonrival, nonexcludable nature of the public domain would seem to limit its appeal to creators in a competitive market. What stimulates creators to invest in transforming or republishing public domain works? How do firms gain and sustain competitivecompetitiveadvantage when exploiting freely available public domain materials? What policy options are available to promote market uptake of public domain mate-rials, and what are the likely impacts? UK copyright in previously unpub-lished work does not presently expire until 1 January 2039. The current term expiry of 31 December 2039 was introduced by the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. Once the term has passed, works become freely available for use, which may include adaptation. A large amount of material in the public domain remains unavailable and underused because its status has not been ascertained. Public domain works include myths and stories from antiquity, religious iconography and texts, and literary and artistic expressions that were produced before the formalisation of the European copyright system. Public domain material is diverse and includes nonfixedexpressions such as oral traditions and folk tales, common sayings and phrases. The public domain status of folklore or traditional knowledge in some jurisdictions can be ambiguous. The perceived risk of a legal challenge may dissuade creators from making use of ideas and works in the public domain. A number of cases in the UK courts have hinged on the question of uptake of ‘common elements’ available to all. For example, common elements might include the iconic London double decker bus, a well known street or occult themes such as magic or wizardry. Judge Birss QC held that the Defendants’ work did reproduce a substantial part of the claimant’s artistic work. He said that despite the absence of some important compositional elements, they include the key combination of what I have called the visual contrast features with the basic composition of the scene itself. Byblos’argument that Rowling has used elements from the public domain does not in principle affect the possibility that Rowling’s book (in which the storyline is developed) is a work for the purposes of the Copyright Act. The Court found thatTanja Grotter and the Magic Double Bass was not recognisable as a parody in terms of the above meaning. Legal and literary scholars Grosheide and Rose have commented on this feature of creativity by surveying the public domain through the lens of copyright. They use the metaphor of the beehive, which enables an owner to transform stored honey into any product of its own making. The concept of ‘permeation’ is of particular importance in the context of the digital landscape. This result is frequently seen in efforts tocommercialise ‘fan’ fiction. The rights conferred to authors under sections 16–21 of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 extend beyond a simple copyright in the actual languageused in an expression. Fictional characters have proved to be at the forefront of this issue – also in terms of litigation – more so than in the case of plot, theme, genre and so on. The protection of literary characters also does not rest on ‘individual elements’ attributed to a character. Instead, it is the collection of attributes, features, well known quotations and so forth which go to make up the imaginary world in which the character moves. In Leslie Klinger v Conan Doyle Estate,77 Judge Posner established that it is not possible to ‘find any basis in statute or case law for extending a copyright beyond its expiration’ When a story falls into the public domain, story ele-                ments – including characters covered by the expired copyright – become fair game for follow-on authors. Free software licences ‘invoke intellectual property rights as the basis for a licensing strategy aimed at preserving the digital commons that the program’s developer wished to establish for it’ Free and open licensing schemes allow creators to specify the types of reuse which are permitted. Not all works licensed under such schemes can be thought to exist wholly in the public domain. 12 per cent of the images con-tained in our sample of biographical pages of authors, lyricists and composers were used under unrestrictive open licences such as Creative Commons. The actual rate of use of Creative Commons licensed images on Wikipedia is likely higher, since our sample comprised a large number of subjects whose deathoccurred more than 70 years ago. In summary, this study relies on the definition of the public domain set out in Table 4.1. The main log analysis to present the main findings to both present and future policy makers is shown. The final section of this chapter presents the results of three interrelated research projects drawn from the UKIPO-ESRC Study. Public domain availability makes a significant difference to inclusion of images on Wikipedia. Pages with public domain images attracted between 17 and 19 per cent more visitors than pages where no image was available. Using commercially equivalent licence fees, we estimate a total value of US$208 million per year for the 1,983,609 English lan-guage Wikipedia pages in appropriate categories. The researchers sought to supply robust evidence on the performance of public domain materials in a limited number of specific markets. Previous attempts to calculate the total contribution of categories of ‘copyright industries’ to national accounts have failed. Public domain materials appear to attract a higher rate of funding and success on the Kickstarter platform. There are attractive aspects to working with public domain inputs that do not depend on excludability. Overexploitation (sometimes called ‘overgrazing’) does not appear to be a concern for creative managers. There is a lack of knowledge among practitioners as well as a gap in terms of information services.
